## Get started with Azure AI Services

 - Prepare to develop AI solutions on Azure
   - Define artificial intelligence: AI as software that exhibits one or more human-like capabilities: `visual perception`,`text analysis and conversation`,`speech`,`decision making`
   - Understand AI-related terms:
     - **data science**: Data science is a discipline that focuses on the processing and analysis of data; applying statistical techniques to uncover and visualize relationships and patterns in the data, and defining experimental `models` that help explore those patterns.
     - **machine learning**: Machine learning is a subset of data science that deals with the training and validation of `predictive models`. Typically, a data scientist prepares the data and then uses it to train a model based on an algorithm that exploits the relationships between the `features` in the data to predict values for unknown `labels`.
     - **artificial intelligence**: Artificial intelligence usually (but not always) builds on machine learning to create software that emulates one or more characteristics of human intelligence.
   - Understand considerations for AI Engineers:
     - **model training and inferencing**: Many AI systems rely on predictive models that must be `trained` using sample data. The training process analyzes the data and determines relationships between the `features` in the data and the `label`. After the model has been trained, you can submit new data that includes known `feature` values and have the model predict the most likely `label`. Using the model to make predictions is referred to as `inferencing`. Many services and frameworks require the process of training a model using exsiting data before using ti to inference new values.
     - **probability and confidence scores**: A well-trained machine learning model can be accurate, but no predictive model is infallible. In most cases, predictions have an associated confidence score that reflects the probability on which the prediction is being made. Software developers should make use of confidence score values to evaluate predictions and apply appropriate thresholds to optimize application reliability and mitigate the risk of predictions that may be made based on marginal probabilities.
     - **responsible ai and ethics**: It's important for software engineers to consider the impact of their software on users, and society in general; including ethical considerations about its use. The human-like nature of AI solutions is a significant benefit in making applications user-friendly, but it can also lead users to place a great deal of trust in the application's ability to make correct decisions. The potential for harm to individuals or groups through incorrect predictions or misuse of AI capabilities is a major concern, and software engineers building AI-enabled solutions should apply due consideration to mitigate risks and ensure fairness, reliability, and adequate protection from harm or discrimination.
   - Understand considerations for responsible AI:
     - **fairness**: AI systems should treat all people fairly. (no bias based on gender, ethnicity or etc)
     - **reliability and safety**: AI systems should perform relibly and safely. Unreliability in these kinds of system can result in substantial risk to human life. As with any software, AI-based software application development must be subjected to rigorous testing and deployment management processes to ensure that they work as expected before release.
     - **privacy and security**: AI systems should be secure and respect privacy. Personal details must be kept private.
     - **inclusiveness**: AI systems should empower everyone and engage people regardless of physical ability, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or other factors.
     - **transparency**: AI systems should be understandable. Users should be made fully aware of the purpose of the system, how it works, and what limitations may be expected.
     - **accountability**: People should be accountable for AI systems. Although many AI systems seem to operate autonomously, ultimately it's the responsibility of the developers who trained and validated the models they use, and defined the logic that bases decisions on model predictions to ensure that the overall system meets responsibility requirements.
   - Understand capabilities of Azure Machine Learning: a cloud-based platform for running experiments at scale to train predictive models from data, and publish the trained models as services. Features:
     - **Automated machine learning**
     - **Azure Machine Learning designer**
     - **Data and compute management**
     - **Pipelines**
   - Understand capabilities of Azure AI Services:
     - **natural language processing**: text analysis, QnA, translation, speech...
     - **knowledge mining and document intelligence**: ai search, document intelligence, custom document intelligence, custom skills...
     - **computer vision**: image analysis, face, video analysis, OCR...
     - **decision support**: content moderation...
     - **generative ai**: azure openai, dall-e image generation
   - Understand capabilities of Azure OpenAI Service: Generative AI models depend on large language models (LLMs) based on the transformer architecture that evolved from years of machine learning progress. Generative AI models are often queried with natural language prompts, and return an impressively accurate response when prompted correctly. `Azure OpenAI Service` is an Azure AI service for deploying, utilizing, and fine-tuning models developed by OpenAI. 
   - Understand capabilities of Azure AI Search: Azure AI Search is an Applied AI Service that enables you to ingest and index data from various sources, and search the index to find, filter, and sort information extracted from the source data. In addition to basic text-based indexing, Azure AI Search enables you to define an `enrichment pipeline` that uses AI skills to enhance the index with insights derived from the source data. Not only does this AI enrichment produce a more useful search experience, the insights extracted by your enrichment pipeline can be persisted in a knowledge store for further analysis or integration into a data pipeline for a business intelligence solution.
 - Create and consume Azure AI services: Azure AI services includes a wide range of individual services across multiple categories: `language`,`speech`,`vision`,`decision`. Different services can work together as a solution for certain scenario, such as `Azure AI document intelligence`,`Azure AI immersive reader`,`Azure cognitive search`,`Azure openai`
   - Create Azure AI services resources in an Azure subscription
     - multi-service resource and single-service resource(separated endpoints)
     - Training and prediction resources: some services offer separate resources for model training and prediction.
   - Identify endpoints, keys, and locations required to consume an Azure AI services resource.
     - `endpoint`: http address through which the service can be accessed.
     - `subscription key`: a valid key that must be provided when accessing endpoints
     - `resource location`: when provisioning a resource in Azure, this resource is assigned to a location, whhich determines the Azure data certer.
   - Use a REST API and an SDK to consume Azure AI services.
 - Secure Azure AI services
   - Consider authentication for Azure AI services
     - `regenerate subscription keys` (two keys for each ai service)
     - `protect keys with azure key vault`: Azure key vault can securely store secrets(passwords or keys). Access to key vault is granted to `security principals` which are authenticated user identities using `Microsoft Entra ID`. A security principal can be assigned to an application to define a `managed identity` for the application.
     - `token-based authentication`: When using the REST interface, some AI services support (or even require) token-based authentication. In these cases, the subscription key is presented in an initial request to obtain an authentication token, which has a valid period of 10 minutes. Subsequent requests must present the token to validate that the caller has been authenticated. (when using sdk, obtaining and presenting tokens are handled by sdk)
     - `Microsoft Entra ID authentication`: can be used to grant access to specific `service principals` or `managed identities` for apps and services.
       - `authenticate using service principals`
         - create a custom subdomain
         - assign a role to a service principal for you app
       - `authenticate using managed identities`
         - `system-assigned managed identity`: one-to-one, deleted when service deleted
         - `user-assigned managed identity`: reusable identity
   - Manage network security for Azure AI services: by default, azure ai services are accessible from all networks. But we can go to `networking/firewalls and virtual networks` to enable network restrictions.
 - Monitor Azure AI services
   - Monitor Azure AI services costs: using `azure pricing calculator` to create a new `estimate` and select an azure ai service you want to use (can choose multiple services). To view costs for the ai services, go to subscription --> cost analysis tab and view only costs for certain service by adding filters.
   - Create alerts and view metrics for Azure AI services
     - create alerts: create `alert rules` to configure notifications and alerts for your resources based on events or metric thresholds. `scope`: the resource to monitor; `condition`: on which the alert is triggered(`signal type`: `activity log` or `metric`); `optional actions`: sending emails or running azure logic aap to address the issue; `alert rule details`: such as the name of the alert rule and resource group where it should be defined.
     - view metrics: can add multiple metrics to a chart and choose appropriate aggregations and chart types.
     - add metrics to a dashboard
   - Manage Azure AI services diagnostic logging
     - create resources for diagnostic log storage: you can use Azure Event Hub as a destination so that then forward the data to a custom telemetry solution or 3rd party solution. But in most cases, you can use `Azure log analytics`, or `Azure storage`. **note**: create these resources before configuring diagnostic logging for your services
     - Configure diagnostic settings: go to `Diagnotic settings`, and specify the `name`, `catogories` of log event data to be captured, `details` of the destinations to store the data.
     - View log data in Azure Log Analytics
 - Deploy Azure AI services in containers
   - Create containers for reuse: pull container images from a registry and deploy it to a container host.
   - Deploy to a container and secure a container: download a contain image for specific azure ai service api and deploy it to ACI, or AKS or a local docker server. the usage metrics will be sent to azure ai services resource to calculate the billing.
     - configuration: `apikey`, `billing`,`eula`
     - containers:
       - language containers
       - speech containers
       - vision containers
   - Consume Azure AI services from a container: no need to provide subcription key, but has to implement your own authentication solution and network security restrictions.

   - Generate a smart-cropped thumbnail and remove background:
     - thumbnail: specify `dimensions` and `region of interest` of the image
     - remove background: `alpha matte` of the foreground subject
 - Image classification with custom Azure AI Vision models
   - Create a custom Azure AI Vision classification model: (the types of custom models include `image classification`,`object detection`, and `product recognition`:more accuracy than `object detection`) first create an azure ai services resource or azure ai vision resource, then create a custom project.
     - Components of a custom Vision project: a `dataset` is the collection of images which is stored in an azure blob storage container, and a `COCO` file is the file that defines the labal info about those images. And the steps to take to train models:
       - create blob storage container and upload images
       - create dataset and connect it to the blob storage container, also define the type of project
       - label your data in azure ml data labeling project, which creates the COCO file in the blob storage container (each category need 3-5 images)
       - connect COCO file to the dataset
       - train custom model on dataset and labels
       - verify performance and iterate it if need
     - COCO files(json file):
       - images

       - QualityForRecognition (low, medium, or high)
     - Facial landmark location - coordinates for key landmarks in relation to facial features (for example, eye corners, pupils, tip of nose, and so on)
     - Face comparison - you can compare faces across multiple images for similarity (to find individuals with similar facial features) and verification (to determine that a face in one image is the same person as a face in another image)
     - Facial recognition - you can train a model with a collection of faces belonging to specific individuals, and use the model to identify those people in new images.
     - Facial liveness - liveness can be used to determine if the input video is a real stream or a fake to prevent bad intentioned individuals from spoofing the recognition system.
   - Compare and match detected faces: when a face is detected, a unique id will be assigned to it and retained in the service resource for 24 hrs, and this id has no indication of this individual's identity other than their facial features, which can be used for facial comparison.
   - Implement facial recognition: (this feature is related to personal information, thus needs to apply for use)
     - create a `Person Group` that defines the sets of people you wanna identity
     - add `Person` to the `Person Group` for each person
     - add detected faces from multiple images to each `person`, the id for the person will persist (`persisted faces`)

     - Scene segmentation - a breakdown of the video into its constituent scenes.
   - Extract custom insights: Azure Video Indexer includes predefined models that can recognize well-known celebrities, do OCR, and transcribe spoken phrases into text. You can extend the recognition capabilities of Video Analyzer by creating custom models for:
     - `people`: add images of the faces appear in the videos, and train the model to make video indexer recognize them
     - `language`: train a custom model to detect and transcribe specific terminology
     - `brands`; train a custom model to recognize names of brands, products,etc

     - semantic ranking has two functions; it uses BM25 and language understand models to calculates a new relevance score
     - semantic captions and answers: Semantic captions extract summary sentences from the document verbatim and highlight the most relevant text in the summary sentences. Semantic answers is an optional additional feature of semantic ranking that provides answers to questions.
     - How semantic ranking works: using BM25 to get top 50 results, then results will be split into multiple fields which will be converted into text strings and then be passed to machine reading comprehension models to find the phrases and sentences that best match the query.
     - advantages:
       - semantic ranking makes results more closely matched the original query
       - can generate semantic captions and answers
     - limits: no other additional info that weren't returned by BM25; only the top 50 results will be considered

   - Set up semantic ranking: enabled at service level, working for all indexes, and then configure it on a per-index basis
   - Perform semantic ranking on an index
 - Perform vector search and retrieval in Azure AI Search
   - Describe vector search: Vector search is a new capability available in AI Search used to index, store and retrieve vector embedding from a search index. You can use it to power applications implementing the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, similarity and multi-modal searches or recommendation engines. A vector query can be used to match criteria across different types of source data by providing a mathematical representation of the content generated by machine learning models. This eliminates the limitations of text based searches returning relevant results by using the intent of the query.
     - when to use vector search
       - use openai or other open source model to encode text and use queries encoded as vector to retrieve documents
       - do a similarity search across encoded images, text, video and audio or mix
       - build a hybrid search using vector and searchable text, vector search is implemented at field level, the results will be merged into a single response.
       - creaet a vector database
       - add filters to text and numeric fields and include this in the query to reduce the data that vector search needs to process
   - prepare search:
     - check index has vector fields: run an empty query to see if there is a `vector` field with a number array. or look for a field named `vectorSearch` with a type `Collection(edm.single)`, which has an algorithm configuration and an attribute of 'dimension'.
     - convert a query input to a vector (an embedding model will convert query to a vector)
   - Describe embeddings: An embedding is type of data representation that is used by machine learning models. an embedding as an array of numbers, and the numerical distance between two embeddings represents their semantic similarity.
     - embedding models: different models for different types of search `similarity search`,`text search`,`code search`
     - embedding space: In this embedding space, similar items are located close together, and dissimilar items are located farther apart.
   - Run vector search queries using the REST API

## Develop Generative AI solutions with Azure OpenAI Service
 - Get started with Azure OpenAI Service
   - Create an Azure OpenAI Service resource and understand types of Azure OpenAI base models(gpt-4, gpt-3.5, embeddings models, dall-e models).
   - Use the Azure OpenAI Studio, console, or REST API to deploy a base model and test it in the Studio's playgrounds.
     - completion playground
       - temperature: low --> high randomness
       - max lenght(tokens)
       - stop sequences: make responses stop at a desired point, such as the end of sentence or list
       - top probabilities(top P): low --> high randomness (do not configure it along with temperature)
       - frequency penalty: reduce the likelihood of repeating the same text in a response
       - presence penalty: reduce the likelihood of any token that has appeared in the text at all so far, which increase the likelihood of introducing new topics in a response.
       - pre-response text: can help prepare the model for a response
       - post-response text: can encourage further user input
     - chat playground: zero-shot or few-shot
       - max response: api supports a maximum of 4000 tokens per prompt
       - top P: the same as that of completion playground
       - past messages included: number of past messages to include in each new api request to give the model context for new user queries
   - Generate completions to prompts and begin to manage model parameters.
     - prompts: a text portion of a request sent to the deployed model endpoint
     - completions: a response comes back in form of text, code, or other formats
     - prompts types:
       - classifying content
       - generating new content
       - holding a conversation
       - transformation(translation and symbol conversion)
       - summarizing content
       - picking up where you left off
       - giving factual responses
     - completion quality:
       - the way a prompt is engineered
       - model parameters
       - data the model is trained on
 - Build natural language solutions with Azure OpenAI Service
   - Integrate Azure OpenAI into your application
     - create an azure openai resource
     - choose a model to deploy
     - authentication and specification of deployed model
     - prompt engineering
   - Differentiate between different endpoints available to your application
     - completion
     - chatCompletion
     - embeddings
   - Generate completions to prompts using the REST API and language specific SDKs
 - Apply prompt engineering with Azure OpenAI Service
   - Understand the concept of prompt engineering and its role in optimizing Azure OpenAI models' performance.
     - prompt engineering: the process of designing and optimizing prompts to better utilize AI models. (can also design prompts to understand how models reach the response or how models make decisions)
     - parameters: `top P`, `temperature` (do not configure both at the same time)
   - Know how to design and optimize prompts to better utilize AI models.
     - provide clear instructions: recency bias can affects models. placing instructions(or most recent messages) at the end of the prompt will make models generate better responses
     - use section markers: `---` or `###` to contain content to help models differenciate between instructions and contents
     - primary, supporting, and grounding content: `primary content`: the subject of the query. `supporting content`: the content that may alter the response, not focus on the subject of the prompt. `grounding content`: allows the model to provide more reliable answers by providing content for the model to draw answer from. 
     - cues: used with instructions, particularly useful when generating code
   - Include clear instructions, request output composition, and use contextual content to improve the quality of the model's responses.
     - request output composition
     - system message: at the beginning of the propmts
     - conversation history (chatgpt includes history automatically)
     - few shot learning
     - break down a complex task
     - chain of thought--> a method to help break down your task effectively is to ask the model to explain its chain of thought.

   - Use the Azure OpenAI REST interface to integrate DALL-E image generation into your apps: (`prompt`,`n`,`size`) for initial request, then the response has a `operation-location` header with a url to call to poll the generated images
 - Implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Azure OpenAI Service
   - understand RAG with azure openai service: models can reference both the specific data provided and its pretrained knowledge to provide more effective responses.
     - receive the prompt
     - analyze the prompt (relevant content and intent)
     - query the search index with the content and intent
     - insert search result into azure openai prompt, along with system message and user prompt
     - send the entire prompt to azure openai
     - return the response
     - `by default, openai encourage model to use your data, but it can be unseleted, and when unselected it, model will only use its pre-trained knowledge`
     - `fine-tuning vs RAG`: `fine-tuning`: train an existing model with additional data, which is more costly and time-consuming. `RAG`: remove the requirement of training a custom model and simplify the interaction with the model, the ai search service will find useful information and add it to the prompt as grounding data, and then azure openai will generate responses based on that information.
   - add your own data and chat with your model using your own data
     - limits: system message < 200 tokens; response < 1500 tokens

## Assessments
 - 1st test:
   - A virtual machine in Azure belongs to a virtual network, if we wanna our app which is deployed to a virtual machine to access Azure ai services, then at the firewall level, we can grant access to the virtual network to the specific ai service endpoint.
   - the prerequisites for diagnostic logging are `a log analytics workplace`, `a storage account`
   - `mismatch` error: the api key is not for the correct endpoint of certain kina of azure ai services resource
   - `invalid` error: api key is not for the correct regions.
   - Model_2 Improves accuracy on small, side-view, and blurry faces. (`faceIdTimeToLive` is used for face id caching)
   - for document intelligence, the S0 tier has limit of 500mb and 2000 pages. But, if documents are password-protected, then the process will fail.
   - You need to upload the video, get the video index, and get the thumbnail for each keyframe. Three API calls need to be done to extract keyframes and store them in a disk.
   - custom brands models supports brand detection from speech and visuals.
   - Slate detection is used for clapper boards and digital patterns with color bars, and the custom Language model is used to add words that are not in the model.
   - for ai video indexer, a sentence with special characters will be discarded
   - When training the model, you should avoid repeating an identical sentence multiple times, as it may create bias against the rest of the input. You should avoid including uncommon symbols (~, # @ % &), as they will be discarded. The sentences in which they appear will also be discarded. You should also avoid putting inputs that are too large, such as hundreds of thousands of sentences, because doing so will dilute the effect of boosting.
   - for azure language service, `opinionMining=true` will add aspect-based sentiment analysis, which in turn will make the sentiment more granular so that positive and negative in a single sentence can be returned.
   - key phrase extraction is the feature of azure ai language, and while summarization is a feature that extracts sentences that collectively represent the most important or relevant information within the original content.
   - speech service errors:
     - `Substitution errors` are due to the model needing more training on custom product names and people names in speech-to-text feature of azure ai services.
     - `deletion errors`: Overlapping speakers define.
     - `insertion errors`: People talking in the background are detected.
   - speaker recognition: determine who is speaking, verify and identify
   - speaker verification: text-dependent or text-independent
   - speaker identification: determine an unknown speaker
   - Azure Storage is the only storage provider that can be used by default for batch transcription.
   - The `List entity` is made up of a list of phrases that will guide the engine on how to match the text. When an entity has an ID of type List and is in Strict mode, the engine will only match if the text in the slot appears in the list.
   - for training custom translator, when using bilingual training documents, `be liberal`, any in-domain human translation is better than machine translation (increase bilingual evaluation understudy: BLEU score)
   - BLEU scores: 0 - 100, (40 -60 means a high-quality translation)
   - If the language of the content in the source document is known, it is recommended to specify the source language in the request to get a better translation.
   - ai translator features: `detect language`,`transliterate`,`dictionary lookup`,`dictionary example`
   - Orchestration workflow projects do not support the multilingual option, so you need to create a separate workflow project for each language, which is an azure ai language service feature.
   - Precision measures how precise/accurate a model is.
   - Recall measures the model's ability to predict actual positive classes.
   - F1 score is a function of precision and recall.
   - Active learning is turned on by default. You can use active learning for this instead of manually logging the questions and adding them.
   - Active learning suggestions are not in real time. There is an approximate delay of 30 minutes before suggestions show on this pane. This delay balances the high cost involved in real-time updates to the index and service performance.
   - The throughput, the size, and the number of knowledge bases affect the pricing tier
   - ai search projection types:
     - tables: data that is best represented as rows and columns, or whenever you need granular representations of your data.
     - files: when you need to save normalized, binary image files.
     - objects: when you need the full JSON representation of your data and enrichments in one JSON document.
   - ai search queryType:
     - simple: query input as-is
     - full: wildcard, fuzzy, regex, field-scoped queries...
   - Document cracking is the process of opening files and extracting content. It is the first stage of the indexing process. (document cracking, field mappings, skillset execution, output fields mappings, push into index)
   - `Microsoft.Skills.Util.DocumentExtractionSkill` is the built-in skill used to extract content from a file within the enrichment pipeline.
   - `name`, `description`, and `skills` are required for defining `skillset`
   - document intelligence supports pdf, and microsoft office files
   - The system message is included at the beginning of the prompt and is used to prime the model with context, instructions, or other information relevant to the use case. You can use the system message to describe the assistant’s personality, define what the model should and should not answer, and define the format of model responses.
   - When the retirement date is reached, the model will upgrade to the default version automatically at the time of retirement.
   - for DAll-E, The result from the initial request does not immediately return the results of the image generation process. Instead, the response includes an `operation-location` header with a URL for a callback service that your application code can poll until the results of the image generation are ready. The `result` element includes a collection of `url` elements, each of which references a PNG image file generated from the prompt.
   - to make http requests to azure openai dall-e model api, you need to ensure that http headers includes `api version`,`name of azure openai service resource`,`name of dall-e model deployment`
   - when making http requests to azure openai dall-e model API, the body is the prompt
   - Azure OpenAI on your data enables developers to use supported AI chat models that can reference specific sources of information to ground the response. Adding this information allows the model to reference both the specific data provided and its pretrained knowledge to provide more effective responses.
   - The Strictness parameter sets the threshold to categorize documents as relevant to your queries. Raising the Strictness parameter value means a higher threshold for relevance and filters out more less-relevant documents for responses.
   - for prompting: `Be Specific` means to leave as little to interpretation as possible. `Be Descriptive` means to use analogies. `Order Matters` means that the order in which you present information to the model can affect the output. Therefore, those three are valid best practices.
